# Biome

We currently have 5 Biome instances

```go
biomeInstances := [5]topLevelObjects.Biome{
    {
        Name:              "muddyPlains",
    },
    {
        Name:              "forest",
    },
    {
        Name:              "rockyPlains",
    },
    {
        Name:              "desert",
    },
    {
        Name:              "wasteland",
    },
}
```

we plan on making wasteland a pvp zone( hadn't been clearly defined yet )
